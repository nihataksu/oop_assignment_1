class MultipleLinearRegression:

    def train:
        #This class should have a train method which calculates the parameters as from Equation (10) based on a given training dataset
        # of observations and ground truth.
            # â€“ You can pick the format for the dataset you prefer; however,
            # we suggest it to be encoded in a tabular/matrix form with the
            # rows representing the n units and the columns representing
            # the p features. Similarly, the ground truth should be a single
            # columnm table/vector of size n.
